# EDS-unicorn-project
This project applies machine learning methodologies to a public dataset of unicorn startup companies (defined as having $1bn+ valuation). The goal is to predict which companies will become a super unicorn (defined as being the top 25% unicorns in size). Four types of machine learning models are considered: Logistic regressions (L1 and L2 penalty), Random Forest classifier, and Gradient Boosting classifier.
It is created to fulfill the requirements to obtain a certificate from Elite Data Science
